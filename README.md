# Notes:

- Problem: The main issue in the code is that I cannot get the images to load for the new HTML documents I found. 
    The reason I believe is because different versions of Google have different layouts, thus making the calculated regex incompatible.
    It works with the version provided (The Van Gogh), but not newer version which I downloaded today.

- Time taken: In transparency, I spent about 5 hrs completing this task. I really enjoyed the challenge and ended up going into quite some detail. 

- Run: You can run `tests.py` which will generate the JSON files for the 3 pages I worked on as well as the test result.

- Note: I knew about `Beautiful Soup` HTML parser, but decided not to use it as I felt part of the challenge was to figure out how to parse the file. Thus, I chose pure RegEx for my implementation. (It also could prove to be better performance, but I didn't test this).
