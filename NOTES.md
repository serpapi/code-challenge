# Approach

I had two takes at this:

- In my first approach I wanted to be "smart" and parse the file without relating on CSS classes. In general this approach may make sense, however it's an overkill for this simple take-home task.
- The second approach was to use CSS classes to identify the elements. This is much simpler. The only caveat is that the CSS classes may change in the future. In such case the paths pointing to given elements will have to be updated.

- I created V1 and V2 classes, but in reality this could also be some sort of a config. I figured that my approach would be good enough and if needed we could expand from there.
- I wasn't quite able to get a carousel with similar page layout, therefore I resorted to [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vincent+van+Gogh+artwork&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLQz9U3MI_PNVKCs7QEgzNTUssTK4v9UitKgktSC4ofMXpxC7z8cU9YynHSmpPXGK25RMLzi7KLg1JzEktSU0Ly_ZOyUpNLhMS42FzzSjJLKoV4pLi44CYmcXNxcrE7FpWUAzXx_GIUC0jNL8hJVUjMKc5XKE5NLErOUEjLL1rEKhGWmZecmleiUJaYp-Cen56hkAjRNIstlgvTWUIeXOzBpRCrbYUocdQtNkmGWyt6VBj8xX7s68xY7frBxIr_5s-v86sZJwEAw2MMLSYBAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjNnL62-L-AAxW_hf0HHdeIDTsQ4qYDegQIGxAG), which is roughly similar. Then I realized that I could also use other search results in the same context.
